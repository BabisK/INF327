## Loading and exploring the data

The first thing to do is to load the data in the R workspace.
```R
header <- c("HFRI ", "EH", "M", "RVA", "ED", "CA", "DS", "EMN", "MA", "RUS_Rf", "RUS_1_Rf_1", "MXUS_Rf", "MEM_Rf", "SMB", "HML", "MOM", "SBGC_Rf", "SBWG_Rf", "LHY_Rf", "DEFSPR", "FRBI_Rf", "GSCI__Rf", "VIX", "Rf")
dates = seq(from = as.Date("1990-04-01", format='%Y-%m-%d'), to = as.Date("2005-12-01", format='%Y-%m-%d'), by = 'month')
as_data <- read.table("data_assignment.txt")
colnames(as_data) <- header
rownames(as_data) <- dates
```

Now we are going to plot all the dependent variables:
```R
par(mfrow=c(4,2))
for (col in c("HFRI ", "EH", "M", "RVA", "ED", "CA", "DS", "EMN")){
  plot(ts(data = as_data[[paste(col)]], start = c(1990, 4), end = c(2004, 12), frequency = 12), ylab = paste(col))
}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
